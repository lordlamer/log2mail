This file describes the configuration file syntax of log2mail.

log2mail takes his configuration either from one file (specify
a file as configuration "file") or from all (not hidden) files
in a directory (specify a directory as configuration "file").

Each configuration file may contain the following expressions:

include = FILENAME

defaults 

file = FILENAME


include includes the content of FILENAME at the exact location
in the configuration file.

defaults and file start sections.


A defaults-section must be the first section in a configuration 
file.

For each file (or globally for all files in the defaults-section)
you may specify patterns:

defaults|file = FILENAME
  pattern = PATTERN
    mailto = MAIL
      fromaddr = FROM
      sendtime = TIME
      resendtime = TIME
      maxlines = NUMBER
      template = FILENAME
      sendmail = EXECUTABLE ARGUMENTS

Each pattern may have one or more mailto addresses. 
For default value specification pattern and/or mailto may be omitted.
You may not specify "mailto" without "pattern".
